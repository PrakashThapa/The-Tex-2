\label{code:mongodb-person0}

As defined in Section~\ref{nosql-mongodb}, collection consists of group of documents with similar structure. Therefore, the data modeling concept of \ref{xmark-nosql} has to be modified marginally for MongoDB. Each \textit{doctype} from Section~\ref{xmark-nosql} is represented as a  collection and this field is removed from document.
For \textit{item} entity,  field \textit{regions} does not change. The \textit{\_id} is the primary index of a document in MongoDB, the identifier attribute of the XMark data \textit{id} is renamed to \textit{\_id} for default indexing.  \textit{closed\_auctions} and \textit{catgraph} do not have an identifier attribute \textit{id}, therefore, system will automatically generate the \textit{\_id} in these collections.
A typical example of MongoDB document for person with identifier \textit{person0} is given in Figure~\ref{code:mongodb-person0}.
