RethinkDB stores data in the form tables which are similar to collections in MongoDB.  Each Section~\textit{doctype} of \ref{xmark-nosql} is represented as an individual table. The tables \textit{regions}, \textit{people}, \textit{open\_auctions}, \textit{closed\_auctions}, \textit{catgraph} and \textit{categories} contains the respective documents as of \textit{doctype} in \ref{xmark-nosql}. Hence the attribute \textit{doctype} is removed from all documents.  \textit{id} is the primary key and any document without \textit{id} field is automatically added as an identifier during the time of insertion. In Figure~\ref{code:rethindb-person0}, an illustration of XMark's person with id \textit{person0} is given
