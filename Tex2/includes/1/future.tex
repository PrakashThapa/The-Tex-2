There are some important aspect is missing in this thesis. All the benchmarking are tested in standalone mode. All the NoSQL databases support multi-datacenter replication and sharding. Benchmarking using multiple cluster and parallel query would be interesting. 

We have tested relatively small size of dataset. These databases are designed to store and process terabytes of data. The benchmarking were done only for read queries. It would be great to test in large database with massive read and write operations together. BaseX was the only XML database for this thesis.
