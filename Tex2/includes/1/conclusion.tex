The goal of this thesis was to investigate and analyze the conversion of data from XML database to NoSQL database.

Both databases  process the data that does not have pre-defined structure. We specifically focused on BaseX, a native XML database and three document-oriented NoSQL databases: MongoDB, Couchbase and RethinkDB. 

We defined the different data models for each of the NoSQL databases based on the XML database for query and benchmarking purposes. The architecture, query model and indexing mechanism of these databases have been studied and examined. The general concept of indexing and query plan of the native XML database BaseX was also investigated. NoSQL database stores data in JSON format. The problems in translating XML to JSON are analyzed. Based the XMark dataset, some algorithms were defined to convert XML into JSON.
The XQuery expressions of the standard XML benchmarking project XMark has been converted into each of NoSQL database queries and evaluated according to the their data model.

We tested and analyzed the performance of all the systems. The experiment is done by running different types and numbers of queries with variable database sizes. 
XQuery is a powerful functional language which is also the query language of XML database. Most of the NoSQL databases support basic queries. MongoDB has relatively better query operations compared to Couchbase query language. ReQL, the query language of RethinkDB is the most advanced among the NoSQL databases.

NoSQL databases are designed to handle a small size of large numbers of documents. They cannot process a huge block of data, but if forced to do so the performance will reduce. The XML databases process a very large size of XML documents. NoSQL database is suited better for an application with massive updates,  because the write operation is atomic in a single document. On the other hand, XML database is best suited for the application that has a large size of documents but fewer write operations.
%If the application has large size of documents but less write operations,  XML database suited better. 

%Even though both of these systems are designed to handle the data that are do not have pre-defined model or  


%In this thesis, we have discussed about the different aspect of semi-structure data and the way they managened. JSON and XML are the most common format to store and transfer the data. Even though their objective are similar, they are incompativale to each other. 
%An algorithms on the besis of XMark dataset was defined to convert XML to JSON.  



%The project was an investigation and comparison of two new database management system  XML database and NoSQL database.  In this project, we have investigated two very famous and most used data format.
