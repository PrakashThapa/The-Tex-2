There are some important aspects missing in this thesis. All the benchmarking was performed in standalone mode in all systems. NoSQL databases support multi-datacenter replication and sharding. Benchmarking using multiple cluster and parallel query could generate the more accurate result. Beside that, we have tested relatively small size of dataset. These databases are designed to store and process terabytes of data. The performance was only tested with read queries. Large data set with massive read and write operation can be benchmark in multiple clusters.
BaseX was the only  XML database for this thesis. It can be tested with other XML databases which supports sharding and  raplication like Marklogic.
