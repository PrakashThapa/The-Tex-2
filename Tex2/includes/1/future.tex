There are some important aspect is missing in this thesis. All the benchmarking is doen using standalone mode. All the NoSQL databases support multi-datacenter replication and sharding. Benchmarking using multiple cluster and parallel query would be interesting. 


We tested relatively small size of dataset only with the read queries. It would be great to test in large database with massive read and write operations. BaseX was the only XML database for this thesis.
