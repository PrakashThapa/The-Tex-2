A synthetic XMARK dataset consists of a huge record in tree structure~\citep{xmark/VIST}. As mentioned in Section~\ref{xmark-dataset}, each subtree, \textit{regions}, \textit{people}, \textit{open\_auctions}, \textit{closed\_auctions}, \textit{catgraph} and \textit{categories} contain large numbers of instances that are indexed during database creation. At first, in most NoSQL database, the dataset cannot be a huge block but in fragmented form with each instances having it's own index structure. Besides this, NoSQL databases limits the size of a single document. For example, MongoDB has a limitation of 16 MB per document, the maximum size of documents allowed in RethinkDB is 64 MB and Couchbase Server can have the value of a key up to 20 MB. The data model of NoSQL does not match the single-instance model of XML database.
\par 
To model XMark dataset into NoSQL, we have broken down the tree structure of XMark into set of sub-structures without losing the overall data. Each NoSQL database has their own data model, hence it is required to define a model for each of those databases separately. The generalized concept of  XMark data into NoSQL databases is explained here but it might slightly differ from one another. 

All sub-trees \textit{regions}, \textit{people}, \textit{open\_auctions}, \textit{closed\_auctions}, \textit{catgraph} and \textit{categories} are the basic units for the document fragmentation. Each of these sub-trees stores entities like \textit{item}, \textit{person}, \textit{open\_auction}, \textit{closed\_auction} and \textit{category}, respectively, as mentioned in Section~\ref{xmark-dataset}. These entities represent the documents in NoSQL databases. In each document, one special field \textit{doctype} is added to represent the name of the parent sub-tree. For example, in case of the \textit{people} sub-tree, the value of \textit{doctype} is \textit{people}. This key/value set will be the part of a document as  given in Table~\ref{tbl:xmark-xml-json}(b). The \textit{doctype} has altogether six distinct values : \textit{categories}, \textit{catgraph}, \textit{people}, \textit{open\_auctions} and \textit{closed\_auctions}. There is an exceptional case for \textit{item} entities. It has \textit{regions} as grandparent and the names of different regions like \textit{asia}, \textit{europe}, \textit{australia}, \textit{namerica}, \textit{samerica} etc. as the parent.  The \textit{doctype} for \textit{item} documents will be \textit{regions} as other. To represent the name of regions like \textit{asia}, \textit{europe}, etc.,  one field with key and value \textit{regions} is added in each document. 
Table~\ref{tbl:xmark-item-type} illustrates the extra attribute added in each of document.
\begin{longtable}{c|c}
	\caption{ Extra attribute of a document in NoSQL}

\newpage
A sample document of NoSQL database along with respective XMark document is illustrated in  Table~\ref{tbl:xmark-xml-json}. The conversion from XML to JSON is carried out using algorithms of Section~\ref{xml-to-json-migration} with one extra attribute "doctype" to represent the parent of a document. If an element in XML has siblings with the same name, they are represented as an array in NoSQL document which is already mentioned in algorithm~\ref{algorithm-JSONXML}. As it can be seen, the \textit{person} element of XMark is itself a document in NoSQL, so it is not necessary to represent this attribute.

\subsubsection{XMARK dataset in MongoDB} \label{xmark-mongodb}
%\input{includes/3/xmark-mongodb}

In MongoDB, collections consist of a group of documents with similar structure. Therefore, the data modeling concept of Section~\ref{xmark-nosql} has to be modified marginally. The documents are grouped with their \textit{doctype} from Section~\ref{xmark-nosql}. Each \textit{doctype} represents a collection, there are 6 collections. The field \textit{doctype} is already represented as a collection, it is removed from all documents.  
For \textit{item} entity,  field \textit{regions} does not change. The \textit{\_id} is the primary index of a document in MongoDB, the identifier attribute of the XMark data \textit{id} is renamed to \textit{\_id} for default indexing.  \textit{closed\_auctions} and \textit{catgraph} do not have an identifier attribute \textit{id}, therefore, the system will automatically generate the \textit{\_id} in these collections. The XMark dataset in MongoDB is represented in Figure~\ref{xmark-mongodb-tree}.
A typical example of MongoDB document for a person with identifier \textit{person0} is given in Figure~\ref{code:mongodb-person0}.

\subsubsection{XMARK dataset in Couchbase} \label{xmark-couchbase}


%\input{includes/3/xmark-couchbase}

Couchbase does not have the concept of grouping documents as \textit{collections} in MongoDB  or \textit{tables} in RethinkDB. 
Therefore, the data model of Section ~\ref{xmark-nosql} is applied without modification.
 All the documents of an XMark instance  are stored in a single bucket with identifier attribute \textit{id} as a document key. An \textit{id} will be manually generated for the documents without identifier.
An example of Couchbase document is illustrated in Figure~\ref{code:couchbase-item0}. The grahical representation of overall dataset in MongoDB is shown in ~\ref{xmark-cb-figure}. The identifier attribute \textit{id}  of XMark data is the document key in Couchbase. The \textit{doctype} with  value \textit{regions} represents it as an \textit{item} and finally the \textit{regions} attribute serves to represent which regions this \textit{item} associates with.

\subsubsection{XMARK dataset in Rethinkdb} \label{xmark-rethinkdb}
%\input{includes/3/xmark-rethinkdb}

RethinkDB stores the documents inside a table which is identical to the collection in MongoDB. 
The documents are grouped according to their \textit{doctype} and store in a table.
Each \textit{doctype} of \ref{xmark-nosql} is represented as an individual table. 
The tables \textit{regions}, \textit{people}, \textit{open\_auctions}, \textit{closed\_auctions}, \textit{catgraph} and \textit{categories} contains the respective documents as \textit{doctype}. Therefore, the attribute \textit{doctype} is removed from all documents.  \textit{id} is the primary key and any document without \textit{id} field is automatically added as an identifier during the time of insertion. Figure~\ref{code:rethindb-person0} shows a document with id \textit{person0} in \textit{people} table.
