There are some important aspects missing in this thesis. All the benchmarking was performed in standalone mode. NoSQL databases support multi-datacenter replication and sharding. Benchmarking using multiple cluster and parallel query can be tested. We have tested relatively small size of dataset. These databases are designed to store and process terabytes of data. The performance was only tested with read queries. It would be great to test in large database with massive read and write operations together. 
\textbf{other xml database }
BaseX was the only representative XML database for this thesis. It can be tested with other XML databases which supports sharding and  raplication like Marklogic. 

\textit{data model} 
We have used XMark data and XQuery expression as our standard and converted it into NoSQL database. This is already favourable for XML database. A neutral benchmarking project can be taken as reference and test for all. 

\textit{Other NoSQL} 
our thesis focus on document-oriented database NoSQL databases. There are many categories of
