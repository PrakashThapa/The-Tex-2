The goal of this thesis was to investigate and analyze the different type of data management system that are able to store and process the data which does not have pre-defined model
%or the data is not in relational in nature. 
We specifically focused on the XML database and document-oriented NoSQL databases. XML database that manages data in the form of XML with richer query features like XQuery and others. Document-oriented NoSQL databaes manages documents in the form of JSON.
The project was also about to convert to data from XML to JSON format. We analyzed the problems  in translation from one format to another and  based on standard benchmarking project XMark dataset, some algorithms are defined to convert data.

We defined the different data model of XML database  to in NoSQL databases for query and benchmarking purpose. The architecture, query model and indexing mechanism of three document-oriented NoSQL databases MongoDB, Couchbase and RethinkDB has been studied and examined. The XQuery expressions of XML database that is based on XMark project has been converted into these databases and evaluated according to the their data model. The general concept of indexing and query plan of the native XML database BaseX which was the representative for XML database in our thesis was evaluated.

The project tested, analyzed and compared the performance of the two database types. The experiment is done including running different types and numbers of queries with variable database sizes. Although the queries are originally based XML database and the out put generated by both system does not match exactly for all queries, the performance was comparable. 

%Even though both of these systems are designed to handle the data that are do not have pre-defined model or  


%In this thesis, we have discussed about the different aspect of semi-structure data and the way they managened. JSON and XML are the most common format to store and transfer the data. Even though their objective are similar, they are incompativale to each other. 
%An algorithms on the besis of XMark dataset was defined to convert XML to JSON.  



%The project was an investigation and comparison of two new database management system  XML database and NoSQL database.  In this project, we have investigated two very famous and most used data format.
